# Parsing artists JSON file

This exercise will take a few steps to complete successfully. Have a look at the `artists.json` file before starting so you have an idea of the structure and information contained.

- Read the `artists.json` into an `artists` DataFrame variable, without using `json_normalize`.
- Remove the `bio` column.
- Set the `name` column as index.
- Save it as `artists.csv` keeping the index.
