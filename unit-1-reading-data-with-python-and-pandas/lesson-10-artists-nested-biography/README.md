# Artists nested biography

This exercise will take a few steps to complete successfully. Have a look at the `artists.json` file before starting so you have an idea of the structure and information contained.

- Read the `artists.json` into an `artists` DataFrame variable, using `json_normalize`. Keep the default index.
- Using the `bio` column, create a new `biography` DataFrame variable with the bio of each artist.
- When creatng the `biography` DataFrame also add the `name` column.
